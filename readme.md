# Code Practice and Challenges

After loosing two year's worth of competitive programming solutions due to a disk-drive failure (among other things), it was time to back up what I had left. I decided to upload them to a Git Repository since they could be useful to anyone struggling with those problems.

## General information

* Most programs are written in Python3, and try to be as self-contained as possible. 

* Those programs that are not self-contained usually include files from the "_auxiliary" folder. In that case, there is a module inside that folder that merges those files into a single self-contained file. (more information in the "_auxiliary" folder's readme)

* Since this is also my working folder, some solutions may not work. I will try to add some clear-cut nomenclature to them (like a "_" in the filename) in the future.
