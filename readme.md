# Coding Practice and Challenges

After loosing two year's worth of competitive programming solutions (among other things) due to a disk-drive failure, it was time to back up what I had left. I decided to upload them to a Git Repository since they could be useful to anyone struggling with those problems.

## General information

* This repository will include a different array of things, from Training Excerise to Competitive Programming Solutions.

* While some programs may be developed in other languages (such as C++), as long as there are no efficiency constrains, my goto language will be Python3. A few exceptions may apply if the challenge requires some specific solution. 

* Since this is also my working folder, some solutions may not work. I will try to add some clear-cut distinction to them (such as a "_" in the folder/file name) in the future.

## Specific Information About Python 3

* All programs will try to be as self-contained as possible, since many online judges do not accept multiple file submission. The exceptions are handled in a way that will preserve this contrain. 

* To work around the need to rewrite the same code-snippets over and over for certain modules or structures (for example: input management), the *_auxiliary* folder contains solutions for some of them. That folder also contains a few utility tools that merges those solutions with a file, resulting in a single self-contained file. (for more information, read the *_auxiliary folder*'s readme)
